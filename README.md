# Footer

Responsive footer rady to use.

Logo is visible up to 900px, but after is disactived to leave more space and make footer smaller when displayed on smaller devices.

## What could I improve?

IF you see anything what could be improved in this small project, please let me know. I'm curious about your opinion. :)
